      <h1>A Career To Not Pursue</h1>
      <p> For this page I had a choice of picking an ethical dilemma, a worldwide or community 
      problem, or a career. I decided to pick a career but, rather than pick a career that is 
      successful, I thought I would pick a career that is not successful and one that people 
      should stay away from. After doing some research I have decided that being an architect 
      is one of the worst areas that a person can pursue. One glaring issue with being an 
      architect today is that no one is making new buildings right now, so hat is the need
      far an architect. People who have majored in architecture have an unemployment rate of 
      13.9 percent.

       <h2>The Money Sucks</h2>
       <p> For as long hours as architects work, they don't make nowhere near what they should. 
       Ina study from US news, the bottom 10% of architects only make roughly $46,000. Only if you are the top 
       10% make about $125,000. The average wage fot architects was about $76,000 so that is when you
       have to wonder, is it worth it? Working ridiculous hours to maybe be successful. I don't feel that it is worth
       it so being an architect sounds like the worst possible job to have.
