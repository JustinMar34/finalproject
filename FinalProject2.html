     <h2>My Interests</h2>
     <p> I don't have a lot of interests but, the things that I am interested in, I am very 
     passionate about them. My main interest in life is baseball. I have been playing baseball 
     since I was four years old and have continued playing to this day. Another interest of
     mine would be cars. I have a couple of dream cars but, the car at the top of that list 
     would be a 69 Dodge Charger.

     <h2>My Goals</h2>
     <p>After high school I plan to attend a Community College where I will continue my baseball career 
     and continue to get an education. After two years of Community College I will transfer into 
     a four year university and graduate from there and if I am fortunate enough, continue my baseball 
     career at that school. I plan on majoring in business and hopefully having a successful 
     career when everything is all said and done.
